# TechaDrunk
A bot that plays the TecheMud game (another bot I created) in Twitch chat.

I created a bot called TechaMud. That bot runs a game I am calling Drunk of Legends which runs in the Twitch chat. The TechaDrunk bot here is essentially a bot that plays that game. He says random stuff, buys drinks, dances, and plays games.

To see this bot in action check out this article: http://techaholica.com/2015/01/10/drunk-of-legends-explained/
